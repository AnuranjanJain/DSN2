    "how can i lower my cholesterol naturally": 
        "To lower cholesterol naturally: eat heart-healthy foods like oats, fatty fish, nuts, and foods rich in soluble fiber. Exercise regularly (aim for 30 minutes daily), lose weight if needed, quit smoking, and reduce alcohol consumption. Consider plant sterols and fiber supplements under medical guidance.",
    
    "what exercises are best for heart health": 
        "The best exercises for heart health include: 1) Aerobic activities like walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming (150 minutes/week), 2) Interval training which alternates intense activity with recovery periods, 3) Strength training with weights or resistance bands (2-3 times weekly), and 4) Flexibility exercises. Always start gradually and consult a doctor if you have existing heart conditions.",
    
    "what does systolic and diastolic blood pressure mean": 
        "Blood pressure readings have two numbers: Systolic (the top number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. Diastolic (the bottom number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart rests between beats. Normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mmHg. High blood pressure increases heart disease risk and often has no symptoms.",
    
    "what are the main risk factors for heart disease": 
        "Major heart disease risk factors include: age (45+ for men, 55+ for women), family history, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol, and chronic stress. Some factors can't be changed, but many can be managed with lifestyle modifications and appropriate medical care.",
    
    "how does the framingham model work": 
        "The Framingham model is based on data from the Framingham Heart Study, which began in 1948. It uses multiple risk factors (age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking status, etc.) to calculate your 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease. Our implementation uses a Random Forest classifier to provide accurate risk predictions based on these factors.",
    
    "what is a normal cholesterol level": 
        "Normal cholesterol levels are: Total cholesterol below 200 mg/dL, LDL ('bad') cholesterol below 100 mg/dL, HDL ('good') cholesterol above 60 mg/dL, and triglycerides below 150 mg/dL. Higher levels may increase heart disease risk. Regular testing is recommended, especially after age 20.",
    
    "what is a healthy bmi": 
        "A healthy BMI (Body Mass Index) ranges from 18.5 to 24.9. Below 18.5 is considered underweight, 25-29.9 is overweight, and 30+ is obese. While BMI is a useful screening tool, it doesn't directly measure body fat or account for muscle mass, so it should be one of several health assessments used.",
    
    "how does diabetes affect heart health": 
        "Diabetes significantly increases heart disease risk by damaging blood vessels and promoting high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and inflammation. People with diabetes are 2-4 times more likely to develop heart disease. Managing blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are crucial for reducing this risk.",
    
    "what are signs of a heart attack": 
        "Heart attack warning signs include: chest pain/pressure/tightness (like a weight on your chest), pain radiating to arms/back/neck/jaw, shortness of breath, cold sweats, unusual fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and lightheadedness. Women may experience more subtle symptoms. If you suspect a heart attack, call emergency services immediately.",
    
    "how can i improve my heart health": 
        "To improve heart health: 1) Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, 2) Exercise regularly (150+ minutes weekly), 3) Maintain a healthy weight, 4) Don't smoke and limit alcohol, 5) Manage stress, 6) Control blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar, 7) Get adequate sleep, and 8) Have regular check-ups."

    r'heart.*test|cardiac test': 
        "Common heart tests include: ECG/EKG (records electrical signals), echocardiogram (ultrasound of heart), stress test (heart function during exercise), cardiac CT/MRI (detailed images), and coronary angiogram (shows blockages). Regular blood pressure and cholesterol tests are also important screening tools.",
    
    r'hypertension.*treatment': 
        "Hypertension treatment may include lifestyle changes (reduced sodium, DASH diet, regular exercise, weight management, stress reduction), and medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, etc.). Treatment plans are individualized based on blood pressure levels, other health conditions, and response to therapy.",
    
    r'atrial fibrillation|afib': 
        "Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heart rhythm that can increase stroke risk. Symptoms may include palpitations, weakness, shortness of breath, and fatigue, though some people have no symptoms. Treatment may include medications to control heart rate/rhythm, blood thinners to prevent clots, and in some cases, procedures like cardioversion or ablation.",
    
    r'palpitations': 
        "Heart palpitations are feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. Most are harmless and triggered by stress, exercise, caffeine, or certain medications. However, persistent or severe palpitations, especially with dizziness or chest pain, should be evaluated by a doctor as they may indicate arrhythmias or other heart conditions.",
    
    r'heart failure': 
        "Heart failure doesn't mean the heart has stopped working, but that it can't pump efficiently. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention (swelling). It's usually managed with medications, lifestyle changes, and sometimes devices or surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve quality of life and prognosis.",
    
    r'heart valve': 
        "Heart valves ensure blood flows in the correct direction through your heart. Valve problems include stenosis (narrowing) or regurgitation (leaking), which can strain the heart. Causes include age-related changes, infections, or congenital conditions. Treatment ranges from monitoring to medication to valve repair or replacement.",
    
    r'coronary artery disease|cad': 
        "Coronary artery disease occurs when plaque builds up in the arteries supplying the heart, limiting blood flow. This can cause angina (chest pain), shortness of breath, or heart attack. Treatment includes lifestyle changes, medications to manage symptoms and risk factors, and possibly procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery.",
    
    r'cpr|cardiopulmonary resuscitation': 
        "CPR can save lives during cardiac arrest. The current recommendation for untrained rescuers is hands-only CPR: 1) Call emergency services, 2) Push hard and fast in the center of the chest at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. Formal training is recommended to learn proper technique including rescue breaths.",
    
    r'aed|defibrillator': 
        "An AED (Automated External Defibrillator) is a portable device that can shock the heart back into normal rhythm during cardiac arrest. They're designed for public use with voice prompts guiding users through the process. When used with CPR in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest, AEDs significantly increase survival chances.",
    
    r'aspirin.*heart': 
        "Low-dose aspirin can help prevent blood clots in people at high risk of heart disease. However, current guidelines no longer recommend aspirin therapy for everyone. The benefits must be weighed against bleeding risks for each individual. Always consult your doctor before starting or stopping aspirin therapy.",
    
    r'antioxidant': 
        "Antioxidants help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, which may contribute to heart disease. Foods rich in antioxidants include colorful fruits and vegetables, nuts, whole grains, and green tea. While a diet rich in these foods is beneficial, antioxidant supplements haven't shown the same heart benefits in research.",
    
    r'omega-?3': 
        "Omega-3 fatty acids may benefit heart health by reducing inflammation, lowering triglycerides, and slightly reducing blood pressure. Good sources include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines), walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds. The American Heart Association recommends eating fish twice weekly. Supplements may be beneficial for some people under medical supervision.",
    
    r'genetic.*heart disease': 
        "Genetics play a role in heart disease risk. Family history of early heart disease (before 55 in men, 65 in women) increases your risk. While you can't change your genes, knowing your family history allows for earlier screening and more aggressive management of other risk factors you can control.",
    
    r'stress.*heart': 
        "Chronic stress contributes to heart disease risk through several mechanisms: raising blood pressure, promoting inflammation, and leading to unhealthy behaviors like overeating or substance use. Effective stress management through regular exercise, adequate sleep, relaxation techniques, and social connections can help protect your heart.",
    
    r'vegetarian.*heart|vegan.*heart': 
        "Well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets can be heart-healthy, as they're typically high in fiber and antioxidants while low in saturated fat. Studies show vegetarians often have lower rates of heart disease. Key nutrients to focus on include protein, omega-3s, vitamin B12, iron, zinc, and calcium, which may require careful food selection or supplementation.",
    
    r'water.*heart': 
        "Staying properly hydrated supports heart health by helping your heart pump blood more easily. Dehydration can strain the heart and trigger abnormal heart rhythms. The amount of water needed varies by individual, but a common recommendation is about 8 cups (64 ounces) daily, with more needed during hot weather or exercise.",

    r'target heart rate': 
        "Your target heart rate during exercise depends on your age and fitness goals. A general formula is 220 minus your age, then take 50-85% of that number for moderate to vigorous intensity. For example, a 40-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 180 and a target range of 90-153 beats per minute. Heart rate monitors can help you track this during workouts.",
        
    r'ecg|ekg|electrocardiogram': 
        "An ECG or EKG (electrocardiogram) records the electrical signals in your heart through electrodes placed on your skin. It can detect abnormal heart rhythms, evidence of heart attacks (past or in progress), and structural issues affecting electrical signaling. It's a quick, painless test that provides valuable information about heart function.",
    
    r'longevity.*heart|lifespan.*heart': 
        "Heart health is closely tied to longevity. Research shows that controlling these seven factors can add years to your life: managing blood pressure, controlling cholesterol, reducing blood sugar, getting active, eating better, losing weight, and stopping smoking.
