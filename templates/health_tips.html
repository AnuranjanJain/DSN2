                <p><strong>Focus on heart-healthy foods:</strong> Incorporate more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your diet.</p>
                <p><strong>Reduce saturated and trans fats:</strong> Limit intake of red meat, full-fat dairy, and fried foods to help manage cholesterol levels.</p>
                <p><strong>Lower sodium consumption:</strong> Aim for less than 2,300mg of sodium per day to help manage blood pressure.</p>
                <p><strong>Increase fiber intake:</strong> Consume 25-30g of fiber daily through foods like oats, beans, and fruits to help lower cholesterol.</p>
                <p><strong>Choose healthy fats:</strong> Opt for olive oil, avocados, nuts, and fatty fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids.</p>

                <h3>Physical Activity</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                <p><strong>Regular aerobic exercise:</strong> Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling.</p>
                <p><strong>Strength training:</strong> Include muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week to improve overall cardiovascular health.</p>
                <p><strong>Daily movement:</strong> Even small amounts of physical activity throughout the day can benefit your heart - take the stairs, walk during breaks.</p>
                <p><strong>Consistency over intensity:</strong> Regular, moderate exercise is often more beneficial than occasional intense workouts.</p>
                <p><strong>Find activities you enjoy:</strong> You're more likely to stick with exercise routines that you find pleasurable.</p>

                <h3>Lifestyle Choices</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                <p><strong>Quit smoking:</strong> Smoking damages blood vessels and significantly increases heart disease risk - quitting can rapidly improve heart health.</p>
                <p><strong>Limit alcohol:</strong> If you drink, do so in moderation (no more than 1 drink daily for women, 2 for men).</p>
                <p><strong>Maintain healthy weight:</strong> Achieving a healthy BMI can reduce strain on your heart and lower disease risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Manage stress:</strong> Chronic stress contributes to heart disease - practice relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga.</p>
                <p><strong>Prioritize sleep:</strong> Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night, as poor sleep is linked to increased heart disease risk.</p>

                <p><strong>Regular check-ups:</strong> Schedule routine health screenings to monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels.</p>
                <p><strong>Know your numbers:</strong> Understand your key health metrics and work with healthcare providers to keep them in healthy ranges.</p>
                <p><strong>Medication adherence:</strong> If prescribed medications for heart health, take them as directed by your healthcare provider.</p>
                <p><strong>Manage underlying conditions:</strong> Effectively treat conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol that contribute to heart disease.</p>
